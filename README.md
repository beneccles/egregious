This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## API Credits
Egregious is powered by the RAWG.io API, a free open source API of over 300,000 video games. Documentation can be found [here.](https://rawg.io/apidocs)

### Egregious Games
Egregious is designed to allow a user to search for a game, and then pick their favorites from the results. The results appear at the bottom of the page in a list, which can then be removed as needed by the user. This was done as my noDB project for DevMountain, as a way to learn more about building with React.
